11 Common diseases of some 
economically important crops
In this section the common diseases of a range of vegetable crops and one field 
crop are recorded to illustrate the diversity of diseases in Vietnam. The diseases 
listed in each table also provide a checklist to help with observations in the field. 
The pathogens responsible for many of these diseases can only be diagnosed 
accurately in the laboratory.
Accurate diagnosis is essential before recommendations can be made on an 
integrated disease management strategy. For example, fungal root rots can be 
caused by many pathogens such as species of Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia 
and Phoma. The appropriate disease management strategy differs between 
these genera.
A diagram of each crop plant is included to assist the reader in learning where to 
look for symptoms of each disease.
A thorough understanding of these diseases will assist the reader in their diagnosis 
of diseases in many other crops.
11.1 Common diseases of chilli
Table 11.1 provides a list of the common diseases of chilli in Vietnam (numbers 
refer to diagram). All diseases may be present in a single crop, and one plant can 
be affected by one or more of these diseases (Figure 11.1).
Phytophthora root rot, basal stem rot, bacterial wilt, root knot nematode and stem 
boring insects all cause similar wilting symptoms.
